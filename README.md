## Design

The most important factor in creating and designing website was showcasing the abilities of the photographer. Each page contains pictures that are meant to inspire potential clients to book a photo session.

### Colour Scheme

Colour palette is very toned down with white background and grey elements not to clash with colours of the photographs. The only other colour introduced is light blue #9aacf8 which is used in the logo designed by the photographer. The same colour is also used on social media icons upon hoover action. 

### Typography

The font used for most of the text including the headers is BenchNine. The font used in contact section 
Both are imported from Google fonts using a link placed in the head of html documents
